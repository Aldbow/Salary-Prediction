**Salary Prediction and Analysis**
---
This repository contains a Python project focused on predicting and analyzing salaries. The project encompasses various stages from handling the data to visualizing insights, applying machine learning regression techniques, and evaluating the results.

**Data Handling and Visualization:**
The project begins with comprehensive data handling techniques to preprocess and clean the dataset. It then utilizes powerful data visualization libraries in Python such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore and visualize key insights from the data. Visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices to better understand the relationships between different features and the target variable - salary.

**Machine Learning Regression:**
Following data preprocessing and visualization, the project applies machine learning regression models to predict salaries based on the available features. Techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting are implemented and compared to find the best-performing model for the dataset.

**Evaluation of Results:**
The final stage of the project involves evaluating the performance of the machine learning models. Metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared, and mean absolute error are used to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions. Additionally, visualizations like residual plots and learning curves provide further insights into the model's performance and potential areas for improvement.
